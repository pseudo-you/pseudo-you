To whom it may concern, 

1. clicking on random public links is not a crime and is definetly not a form of stalking
2. Scrolling on social media and seeing stuff from people on your timeline is not a form of stalking
3. Since I don't have any other way to contact the bingle person I just want to let them know I actually have not opened ponytown and strawpage nearly the whole summer and I'm not the only active romanian in the danmei area. The one main reason I did visit the strawpage from time to time was to see if they re-updated their gallery because I sent a binghe gimmick that they put up a while ago and wanted to see if it was back; that's it. If I remember correctly I either have a screenshot of it or actually put my user on it - as proof.
4. I have no idea who the friend in question is.
5. We never interacted, I have no idea who you have beef with (despite popular belief I'm almost always on another game when active on ponytown and react mostly only to whispers) and over what causes and it's also not my business of meddling in, especially when I don't know anyone who actively talks about you and I have a life of my own.

Thank you for reading thus far
and if someone could send this to the bingle/kyusoob individual it would be appreciated, many thanks

I also don't mind being blocked, I just want them to know more of the other side of the story since I did actually see them talk about me behind my back and did nothing, mea culpa
